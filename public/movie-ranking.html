<h3>The Sandlot</h3>

<p>She swears this is her favorite movie but tbh idek. 
    I coulda sworn it was Princess and the Frog XD. Cool movie ig, can't say that I've ever seen it
</p>

<h3>Princess and the Frog</h3>

<p>Solid movie, I secretly rate it higher that I let her belive bc I can't seem soft yk.
    I still do hate musicals but this one's cute
</p>

<h3>Palm Trees in the Snow</h3>

<p>Tbh idek if this one should even make the list lol. My brain isn't really functioning rn, so. 
    I do remember her talking about this movie when we were high TWICE. She swears it was only once
    and that I was tripping when I told her I remembered having that exact conversation, but ik I wasn't
